# Lemonade Stand Game

This is a student project for [devCodeCamp](https://devcodecamp.com/) 

#### Features:
A weather system that includes a forecast and actual weather, so that I can get a predicted forecast for a day or week and then what the actual weather is on the given day.

Able to go to the store to purchase items (lemons, sugar, ice, and cups) to make lemonade to sell.

The price of product as well as weather/temperature should affect demand, so that if the price is too high, sales will decrease, or if the price is too low, sales will increase, etc.

Each customer to be a separate object with its own chance of buying a glass of lemonade, so that how much lemonade is purchased and how much a customer is willing to pay will vary from customer to customer.

The ability to make a recipe for my lemonade, so that I can include x-amount of lemons, x-amount of sugar, and x-amount of ice.

Game to be playable for at least seven days.

Daily profit/loss displayed at the end of each day, so that I know how much money my lemonade stand has made. Total profit/loss to be a running total that is displayed at the end of each day, so that I know how much money my lemonade stand has made.


#### To-Do:
Game to be playable for more than one player, so that I can have multiple humans play each other or a human play a computer.
Integrate a Weather API, so that my game has real-time weather based on a current temperature and forecast.
